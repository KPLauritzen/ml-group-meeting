Ipython Notebook for my Feb 2017 group meeting

We are running this on a cloud computing service. So you don't have to install anything. 

BUT, if you would like to run this locally, you need these packages:

- numpy
- scipy
- sklearn
- jupyter notebook
- matplotlib

The easiest way to get these is to use the conda environment manager. 
I suggest downloading and installing miniconda (http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html).

Once this is installed, the following command will install all required packages in your Python environment:

`conda install numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn ipython-notebook seaborn`

Alternatively, you can download and install the (very large) Anaconda software distribution, found at https://store.continuum.io/.

This notebook is heavily inspired by Jake VanderPlas' presentation from PyCon 2015
